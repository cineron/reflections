#When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repositories are great for colaborating with others and working on projects remotely and allowing others access to your project.

#Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might be working on something and don't want to apply any changes from the remote.

#Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a clone on GitHub
A branch is a part of a repository that is created in isolation in order to test new ideas and/ or work on new features.
A clone is a copy of a repository either local or remote.

#What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It allows you to work off-line without worrying about being affected by changes.

#How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
GitHub makes collaborating much easier, assuming the collaboraters know how to use Git.  Locally collaborting might be better for a secure environment.
